 <h1>
        <strong>MATTER MATTERS:</strong> RIDER FOR EXHIBITION AGREEMENTS
      </h1>
      <div>
This is an exhibition agreement supplement for those of us who reckon with art and want coherence between
our concern - regarding climate disruption and the megaflop of plastics-reliance and how we live among other
sentient beings whose lives we do not think are less worthy of attention than our own - and how we actually
go about things. They are mores, not lesses; while they are limitations, they are not restrictive. In fact,we
consider them beautiful — a hedonic ethos. We aim to commit to them in a spirit of friendly disagreeableness:
a friendly disagreeableness with the general customs and assumptions, within the mainstream of cultural
production, of what is necessary to make/meet art today.
