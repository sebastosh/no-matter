    "description": "This is an exhibition agreement supplement for those of us who reckon with art and want coherence between our concern - regarding climate disruption and the megaflop of plastics-reliance and how we live among other sentient beings whose lives we do not think are less worthy of attention than our own - and how we actually go about things. They are mores, not lesses; while they are limitations, they are not restrictive. In fact,we consider them beautiful — a hedonic ethos. We aim to commit to them in a spirit of friendly disagreeableness: a friendly disagreeableness with the general customs and assumptions, within the mainstream of cultural production, of what is necessary to make/meet art today."
